## Overview
<p> Records of Glory is an analytical project that explores the historical trends and evolution of the Summer Olympic Games. This project focuses on developing parameterized reports using Microsoft Report Builder, leveraging historical data from the modern Summer Olympics, spanning from the London 1948 Games to the Rio 2016 Games. </p>

<p>The primary objective is to analyze athlete participation, medal distribution, and performance metrics over the years.

<p> ü§ù This project was developed by a group of second year undergraduates (4 members), as part of a university assignment for the BSc in Applied Data Science Communication degree program.</p>
<p> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This project is open-source. Contributions and suggestions are welcome. Feel free to fork and adapt it for your own use.</p>

## Key Features
- <b>Historical Data Analysis:</b> Covers data from the London 1948 Olympics to the Rio 2016 Olympics.
- <b>Microsoft Report Builder Integration:</b> Development of three parameterized reports for dynamic filtering and in-depth analysis.
- <b>Data Cleaning & Processing:</b> Utilized SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for dataset cleaning, wrangling, and preprocessing.
- <b>Interactive Reporting:</b> Reports are built to explore various medal distribution patterns, athlete participation trends, and individual athlete performances.
- <b>Visualization Techniques:</b> Implemented charts, tables, and graphs to enhance data interpretation.
<br>

## Reports Developed

### 1. Medal Distribution Report
- Analyzes the total number of medals won by each country in different Olympic Games.
- Parameters: Year, Medal Type.
- Includes pie charts and bar charts for visualizing medal counts across different nations.

### 2. Athlete Participation Analysis Report
- Examines the number of athletes participating in various sports for each Olympic year.
- Parameters: National Olympic Committee (NOC), Sport.
- Displays bar charts showing participation distribution across different events.

### 3. Athlete Performance Analysis Report
- Focuses on individual athlete performance, analyzing their medal achievements.
- Parameters: Year, Sport.
- Uses pie charts and bar charts to compare medal distributions across different athletes.
<br>

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Microsoft SQL Server : Data storage and management
- Power BI : Data visualization and dashboard creation
- T-SQL : Querying and data processing.
<br>

## Dataset Information
* The dataset used in this project is sourced from: <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Olympic_history_longitudinal_data_scraped_from_www_sports-reference_com/6121274/1?file=11693840"> Olympics History Dataset </a>

* Dataset Characteristics:
    - Initial Data Volume: 271,116 rows √ó 15 columns
    - Primary Attributes: Athlete demographics (Age, Gender, Height, Weight), Event participation, Medal achievements (Gold, Silver, Bronze), Host city information (NOC Codes)
<br>

## Key Insights
### 1. Medal Distribution Trends:
- The highest number of bronze medals in the 2000 Sydney Olympics was won by Germany (64 medals).

### 2. Athlete Participation:
- Softball participation in 2008 shows 15 Venezuelan athletes competing in Athens.

### 3. Individual Athlete Performance:
- In 2004 (Athens Olympics), Yuliya Vladimirovna Pakhalina won both Silver and Bronze medals in Diving.
<br>

## Recommendations for Future Analysis
- Gender-based Medal Analysis: Evaluating trends in male vs. female participation.
- Geopolitical Influence on Performance: Studying the impact of political and economic factors on athlete participation.
- Evolution of Sports: Tracking the growth and discontinuation of various Olympic sports over time.
- Long-term Athlete Success: Analyzing the career progression of medal-winning athletes.
